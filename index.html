                        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At yunified (or “MagicGroup Asia Pte. Ltd.”, “MagicGroup”) we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals</p>
                        <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please <a href="mailto:legal@yunified.com" target="_top">contact us</a>.</p>


                        <p>
                            MagicGroup Asia Pte. Ltd (“ MagicGroup”) operates several websites including <a href="http://www.yunified.com" target="_blank">http://www.yunified.com</a>, <a href="http://www.magicgroup.asia" target="_blank">http://www.magicgroup.asia</a>. It is MagicGroup’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
                        <p>
                            Like most website operators, MagicGroup collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MagicGroup’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MagicGroup’s visitors use its website. From time to time, MagicGroup may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Certain visitors to MagicGroup’s websites choose to interact with MagicGroup in ways that require MagicGroup to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MagicGroup gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with MagicGroup are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, MagicGroup collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with MagicGroup. MagicGroup does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4> 
                        <p>
                            MagicGroup may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. MagicGroup may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MagicGroup does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                        </p>
                        <h4> 
                            Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            MagicGroup discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MagicGroup’s behalf or to provide services available at MagicGroup’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MagicGroup’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MagicGroup will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MagicGroup discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MagicGroup believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MagicGroup, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a MagicGroup website and have supplied your email address, MagicGroup may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MagicGroup and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MagicGroup takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Cookies</h4> 
                        <p>
                            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. MagicGroup uses cookies to help MagicGroup identify and track visitors, their usage of MagicGroup website, and their website access preferences. MagicGroup visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MagicGroup’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of MagicGroup’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
                        <p>
                            If MagicGroup, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MagicGroup goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of MagicGroup may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Ads</h4> 
                        <p>
                            Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by MagicGroup and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Although most changes are likely to be minor, MagicGroup may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MagicGroup’s sole discretion. MagicGroup encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

                            <li>The applicable rules of the website publisher upon whose site you want your ads served.

                            <li>The applicable laws in the United States of America, Canada, the country in which you live, and any country where your ads are served.

                        <p>MagicGroup must approve each ad that you upload before you will be permitted to begin displaying such ad. To increase the likelihood that your ad will be approved, you should ensure that your ad fits within the size parameters specified and complies with all of the applicable submission requirements.</p>

                        <h4>11. Infractions</h4>

In addition to removing an ad, MagicGroup may also suspend and/or delete your account.</p>

                        <h4>12. Third Party Ad Serving</h4>

                        <h4>15. Purchases</h4> 
                        <p>By bidding on ad inventory through the yunified RTB platform, you are making a programmatic offer to purchase such ad inventory.

                        <h4>16. Payment Methods</h4>

MagicGroup uses third-party providers to process payments. As such, MagicGroup is unable to make any guarantees as to how long it will take to post funds to your account.

If you send a wire transfer or use PayPal, the processing and posting of funds to your account may take a few days.</p>

                        <p>If your account has been compromised or is being used in an unauthorized manner, you must immediately notify MagicGroup. You should regularly log into your account and review the details of your spending to ensure that there has not been an unauthorized transaction or other error.</p>

MagicGroup will refund the unused balance in your account (if any), minus an administrative fee of 15%, within 30 days. MagicGroup will only send refunds to the source from which payment was made.

You may be required to provide additional information or documentation in order for MagicGroup to confirm your identity, before any refund request will be processed.</p>

                        <h4>20. Indemnification</h4>
